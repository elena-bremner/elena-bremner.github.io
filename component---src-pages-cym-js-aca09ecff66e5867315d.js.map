Even before the crisis, wearing a mask \n        during the flu season was quite common in China, Japan, and South \n        Korea. Western countries, in contrast, have been slower to embrace \n        facemasks. A few months ago, there was a political stigma to the \n        practice, with some people facing criticism and mockery for being \n        alarmist.  However, as the pandemic has killed nearly one million and \n        sickened nearly 30 million around the world, attitudes have changed. \n        Now, wearing a mask is a symbol of solidarity and considered a public \n        good. Interestingly, the wearing of face masks was mandatory during the \n        1918 pandemic. Thus, almost every image under the Google search \n        “1918 flu U.S.” captures adults, children, and even cats wearing facemasks. \n        <br></br><br></br>\n        I collected around 700 images of people wearing masks from both the \n        1918 flu and COVID-19 and trained it through a machine learning model. \n        <b>  My goal was to capture the essence of the mask, creating a universal \n        symbol of humanity's long struggle against pathogens. </b>\n    </div>\n    <div className={style.section}> Data Collection </div>\n    <p className={style.paragraph}> \n        A total of 700 images were collected through Google search and Instagram \n        scraping.
