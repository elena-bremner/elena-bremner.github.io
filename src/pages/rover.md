    Human exploration rover challenge is an annual competition held by NASA. The participants are required to design a human-powered vehicle that can run on a simulated Mars terrain.
    Our process includes research, testing, and refining. In 2019, our team won the  Featherweight class design award and placed second among 100 other schools.
