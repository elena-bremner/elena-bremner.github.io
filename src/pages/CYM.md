  Back in March 2019, amid the ever-growing debate about the efficacy of facemasks during the Coronavirus crisis, Asian countries were quick to adapt widespread use of face coverings in public. Even before the crisis, wearing a mask during the flu season was quite common in China, Japan, and South Korea. Western countries, in contrast, have been slower to embrace facemasks. A few months ago, there was a political stigma to the practice, with some people facing criticism and mockery for being alarmist.  However, as the pandemic has killed nearly one million and sickened nearly 30 million around the world, attitudes have changed. Now, wearing a mask is a symbol of solidarity and considered a public good. Interestingly, the wearing of face masks was mandatory during the 1918 pandemic. Thus, almost every image under the Google search “1918 flu U.S.” captures adults, children, and even cats wearing facemasks. <br></br><!-- <br></br> -->
  I collected around 700 images of people wearing masks from both the 1918 flu and COVID-19 and trained it through a machine learning model. <b >  My goal was to capture the essence of the mask, creating a universal symbol of humanity's long struggle against pathogens. </b>
