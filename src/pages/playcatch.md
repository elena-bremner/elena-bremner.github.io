desc: "Why compete when you can always win? 
I coded a game where two players 
collaboratively keep a digital ball inside the screen. The two players are guaranteed to win every game.

Once the ball escapes the screen, the players will click the ellipse to continue playing. The players will keep passing the ball until they reach 10 points.
