            This motion design study was part of a class assignment exploring near future worlds. 
            Working along Catherine Park and Hannah Riley, we imagined a world where emotions act as currency 
            in the shape of emojis. This animation is a snapshot of how these emoticons are shipped 
            through pneumatic tubes from each household to a nearby bank.

            During my internship at Deeplocal, I had the opportunity to work on a 
            project for one of Googleâ€™s teams. Our goal was to create a strategic document of how googlers 
            can check-in at Google offices post Covid times. I was asked to illustrate personas for one of 
            their pitch decks.
