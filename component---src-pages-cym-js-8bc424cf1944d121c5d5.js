Even before the crisis, wearing a mask during the flu season was quite common in China, Japan, and South Korea. Western countries, in contrast, have been slower to embrace facemasks. A few months ago, there was a political stigma to the practice, with some people facing criticism and mockery for being alarmist.  However, as the pandemic has killed nearly one million and sickened nearly 30 million around the world, attitudes have changed. Now, wearing a mask is a symbol of solidarity and considered a public good. Interestingly, the wearing of face masks was mandatory during the 1918 pandemic.
